# This recipe will work with csv-chef's randomly generated data from the
# write command. It uppercases the first name, lower cases the last name. It
# also maps the political party abbreviations to their full names. It 
# transforms the sent column based on the date, so if the date is in the 
# past the value will be changed to SENT. It adds a new fullname column by
# combining the first and last names. It also creates a variable 
# representing username by combining the first letter of the first name
# with the last name, and removing any apostrophes, and lowercasing all of 
# that. It then adds that username to a new column. It uses that to build
# an email address using the username along with the last 4 digits of the 
# "voter id" and tacking on "@gmail.com". It's all just for fun.
